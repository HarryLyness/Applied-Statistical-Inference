# Applied-Statistical-Inference

This repository is the group coursework assignment for Applied statistical Inference, a course I took in the first semester of my final year. In general, this course covered:
* Basics of large sample theory of maximum likelihood estimation.
* Basics of numerical optimization.
* Use of numerical optimization for maximum likelihood estimation in R
* Basics of practical Bayesian approach to inference.
* Basic theory of Markov Chain Monte Carlo
* How to code up simple MCMC samplers in R
* Model checking, criticism and interpretation.
* Random effects in models.

The coursework set this year applied content mainly on the first 5 chapters of Core Statistics by Simon N Wood.
